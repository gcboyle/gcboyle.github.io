         <h2>About Us </h2>
         <p> We are a team that celebrates one another and food each and every day. Our mission is to bring bread with an old-soul into the lives of our friends in California. We love to know how breakfast came to be and hope you do too. Read below to find out more! </p>
         <p> Eating breakfast began in the Neolithic (late Stone Age) era, when
            large stones were used to grind grains to make a sort of porridge.
            Porridge was also a staple of Roman Soldiers diets – they called it
            pulmentus.
            During the middle ages, barley and hops were used to make beer
            which was served up in the morning to hungry peasants alongside
            oatcakes or porridge.
         </p>
         <p> Breakfast as we know it began in the early 19th century, when some
            middle-class men started to work regular hours in offices – prior to
            that people would often work for a few hours, then eat a meal at about
            10am. Wives or kitchen staff would often serve these 19th century
            commuters a two-course meal that would often begin with a bowl of
            porridge. This would be followed by a full English breakfast: toast and
            eggs with bacon or fish. This style of meal wasn’t referred to as the
            full English until the First World War when lighter breakfasts grew in
            popularity. 
         </p>
         <p> The range of breakfast foods on offer became more and more varied.
            Now, however, despite the choice available, fewer and fewer people
            take the time to have breakfast.
         </p>
         <p>   The word dinner actually means breakfast as it comes from the Latin
            word disjejunare, which literally means break the fast.
